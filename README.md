# Real Time Ray/Path Tracer

## Overview
This Path Tracer is a C++ project built with OpenGL for visualization. It allows for real-time rendering of 
scenes containing basic shapes like Triangles, Spheres, and Planes as well as basic low-poly models that the 
user can specify.

## Features
- **Real Time Rendering** All rendering and scene modifications are done in real time.
- **Basic Shapes** Supports basic shapes like triangles, spheres, and planes.
- **Basic Materials and lighting** Supports rough and smooth materials alongside diffuse and specular lighting.
- **3D Camera movement** User is able to manuever about the scene with a basic fly style camera.
- **Scene Editing UI** Straightforward scene editing with dynamic ImGui UI.

- OpenGL (4.0 or later)
- GLFW library (included)
- GLAD library (included)
- Assimp (included)

### Hardware
- As strong a computer as you can manage

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
